A cat in his best years, Kurt lives alone in his countryside house, miles outside the small town of Chatmonix. In the vicinity of the grandiose French alps, Kurt has finally found a peaceful place to call home. He has found joy in life.Life has not always been good on Kurt. As a kitten, he experienced the life of a stray cat, a lost soul forever wandering in the peripherals of society. The streets were cold and dark, laden with violence and fear. With nothing left to live for, Kurt turned to darkness. Stealing and lying, begging and cheating was his way of life. As years progressed, Kurt grew older and developed a rugged street mentality and a crude attitude. Feared and respected by most, he quickly drew attention from the big shots in the world of organized crime. Starting off in the gutter dealing catnip, he was regarded as a no-nonsense cat you could trust and count on, even when things went bad. As Kurt got older, he sought the solitude of the mountains. One day he found a message on his doorstep: I am watching you. He cannot be free until he finds a way to pay them back.
